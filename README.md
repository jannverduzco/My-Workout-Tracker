## Description 


## User Story
```
As A user

I WANT to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 

I WANT to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 

I SHOULD also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

SO THAT I can keep an organized progress of my activity
